# pt_precipitation_analysis
This repo contains the analysis of precipitation data in Portugal in the period of 1950-2003

The dataset is inside the ipma folder and the script with the analysis is in src/

ipma_pt2_plot.py has harcoded a single geographical location,
# Specify the latitude and longitude of Monchique land
target_lat = 37.24
target_lon = -8.70

You can change it to the desired GPS coordinates and run (only dependencies are python3)
./python3 src/ipma_pt2_plot.py
