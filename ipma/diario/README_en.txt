It is important to remember that the accumulation periods in Spain an Portugal are different. As I said in the paper: 


"It is important to mention that there are differences in the accumulation period between Spain02 [Herrera et al., 2000] and IB02 datasets.
 For instance, in Spain02 the precipitation for the 11 January 2000 is the accumulated precipitation between 07UTC from 11 January and 07UTC
 from 12 January 2000, while in the IB02 dataset the precipitation for the 11 January 2000 refers to the accumulated precipitation
 between XXUTC from 10 January 2000 and XXUTC from 11 January 2000, where XX is 07 and 09, respectively, in Spain and in Portugal."
